## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Install (interactive -- pick what you want)
npx skills add krzysztofsurdy/code-virtuoso

# 2. Try a skill immediately
/ticket-writer
# Follow the prompts -- paste the output into Jira, Linear, or GitHub Issues.
```

That is the whole tour. For fine-grained install modes (per-skill, global, offline, auto-update) see [Installation (detailed)](#installation-detailed).

---

## Why Use This

- **Battle-tested, not LLM-generated.** Every skill was researched against official docs and community best practices, then hand-curated. No hallucinated API references.
- **Progressive disclosure keeps your context clean.** Skills load a short `SKILL.md` first and only pull in deeper references when the task calls for them. Less context rot, sharper answers.
- **One installation, many tools.** Built on the open Agent Skills standard -- works with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Codex, Gemini CLI, and more. No lock-in.
- **Team-shaped, not pattern-shaped.** The library ships 7 role personas (Product Manager, Architect, Backend Dev, Frontend Dev, QA, PM, Scrum Master) and 15 sub-agents that delegate like a real team rather than a single over-prompted assistant.

## Works Well With

Companion tools that pair naturally with this library.

### Beads -- Task Memory for AI Agents

[github.com/steveyegge/beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)

Distributed, git-backed graph issue tracker that gives AI agents persistent, structured memory for long-horizon tasks. Replaces ad-hoc markdown planning files with a dependency-aware task graph.

### GSD -- Spec-Driven Development

[github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done)

Meta-prompting and context engineering system for Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, and Codex. Targets context rot with spec-driven development, subagent orchestration, and state management.

### Grepika -- Token-Efficient Code Search

[github.com/agentika-labs/grepika](https://github.com/agentika-labs/grepika)

MCP server that replaces built-in grep/file search with ranked, compact results using roughly 80% fewer tokens. Combines FTS5 full-text search, parallel grep, and trigram indexing with BM25 ranking.

## FAQ

**Which AI coding assistants does this support?**
Anything that follows the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard, including Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cline, OpenCode, Continue, Trae, Roo Code, Amp, and more. Skills use portable frontmatter; platform-specific extensions (tool names, isolation, memory) are noted per-agent.

**Do I have to install the full bundle?**
No. Install only the skills you need with `--skill <name>`, or install a single plugin (e.g., `role-backend-dev`, `knowledge-virtuoso`, `tool-ticket-writer`). Each plugin is documented in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

**How do I update?**
Run `npx skills update`. For hands-free upkeep, use one of the auto-update snippets above.

**Can I use skills across multiple projects?**
Yes -- install with `-g` for global availability. Local installs live in the current project only.

**Can I contribute my own skills or agents?**
Yes. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for conventions, the research workflow, `marketplace.json` update rules, and version-bumping policy.

**Why not just prompt-engineer one long CLAUDE.md file?**
One long rule file consumes context on every request. Skills use progressive disclosure -- metadata sits in context, bodies load only when triggered, deep references load only when explicitly needed. You get specialist knowledge without paying for it until it's relevant.
