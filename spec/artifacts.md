# Artifact Specification

Artifacts are the structured outputs that agents produce and the structured inputs they consume. This spec defines standard artifact types so agents can declare explicit handoff contracts via `expects` and `produces` frontmatter fields.

Artifact types are **conventions, not file formats**. The agent producing an artifact writes it in its Output section. The consuming agent reads it as part of its Input. There is no runtime enforcement -- these contracts exist so orchestrators and teams can validate that the output of one agent matches the expected input of the next.

## Artifact Catalog

| Artifact | What it contains | Typical producer | Typical consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| `investigation-report` | Entry points, code flow traces, dependency map, observations | investigator | architect, implementer |
| `architecture-decision` | Context, decision, alternatives considered, consequences | architect | backend-dev, frontend-dev, implementer |
| `requirements-spec` | Problem, goals, acceptance criteria, non-goals, constraints | product-manager | architect, qa-engineer, acceptance-verifier |
| `review-report` | Scope, verdict, severity-ranked findings, strengths | reviewer, cold-reviewer, acceptance-verifier | implementer |
| `smell-report` | Hotspot locations, smell classifications, refactoring recommendations | refactor-scout | reviewer, implementer |
| `test-plan` | Risk areas, test cases, coverage criteria, sign-off conditions | qa-engineer | implementer, reviewer |
| `test-gap-report` | Missing tests by priority, source-to-test file map | test-gap-analyzer | implementer |
| `migration-plan` | Risk classification per operation, execution steps, rollback paths | migration-planner | implementer, reviewer |

## Using Contracts

### In agent frontmatter

Agents declare what they expect and produce using optional `expects` and `produces` fields:

```yaml
---
name: architect
expects:
  - investigation-report
  - requirements-spec
produces:
  - architecture-decision
---
```

Both fields are lists of artifact type names from the catalog above. Agents may also use custom artifact types not in this catalog.

### In teams

Teams use contracts to validate their workflow: the `produces` of phase N should match the `expects` of phase N+1. When reviewing a team definition, check that the chain is consistent.

### Graceful degradation

Agents should handle missing artifacts gracefully. If an agent expects an `investigation-report` but receives raw text or a verbal description instead, it proceeds with a note: "Expected structured investigation report. Proceeding with available context." The contract is a signal for orchestrators, not a hard gate.

## Adding New Artifact Types

If an agent produces output that does not fit any existing type:

1. Check whether an existing type covers it with a broader name
2. If genuinely new, add a row to the catalog table above
3. The type name should be kebab-case and describe the content, not the producer (e.g., `migration-plan` not `migration-planner-output`)
4. Update any agents that would naturally produce or consume the new type

## Portability

The `expects` and `produces` fields are portable across agent platforms. They carry no platform-specific semantics -- they are documentation that any orchestrator can read and act on.
