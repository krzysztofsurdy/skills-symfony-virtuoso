# Agent Teams Library

A catalog of pre-composed agent teams. Each team bundles a roster of agents, a coordination workflow, and entry/exit criteria into a ready-to-use unit. Pick a team and dispatch it via the `dispatching-agent-teams` skill.

## Available Teams

| Team | Workflow | Lead | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| [development-team](teams/development-team.md) | hybrid | Product Manager | Delivering a full feature from requirements to merged PR |
| [review-squad](teams/review-squad.md) | parallel | Reviewer | Multi-perspective code review before merging significant changes |
| [war-room](teams/war-room.md) | war-room | Architect | Structured technical debate that ends in a decision (architecture choice, tech selection, design trade-off) |

## How to Pick a Team

| Situation | Recommended Team |
|---|---|
| "I need to ship feature X end-to-end" | development-team |
| "Code review this PR thoroughly" | review-squad |
| "We need to decide between X and Y" | war-room |
| "Just review the diff" | Skip the team, delegate to `reviewer` agent directly |
| "Investigate this area" | Skip the team, delegate to `investigator` agent directly |

If no team fits the work, skip the team and chain individual agents (see the `using-ecosystem` skill's chaining patterns).

## Team File Format

Every team file follows the team specification (`spec/team-spec.md`):

- **Frontmatter**: `name`, `description`, `lead`, `agents`, `skills`, `workflow`
- **Body**: Purpose, Workflow, Entry/Exit Criteria, Coordination Rules, Spawning

The dispatcher reads these fields to resolve the team, verify entry criteria, and execute the workflow in the appropriate spawning mode.

## Authoring Your Own Team

User-authored teams live at the project root in `teams/{name}.md`. The dispatcher discovers project teams before falling back to the bundled library here, so project teams can override bundled ones by name.

See `spec/team-spec.md` for the full team format and `template/team-template.md` for a starter.
