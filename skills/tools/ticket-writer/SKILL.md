name: ticket-writer
description: Interactive tool to write high-quality tickets of the right type -- story, subtask, issue, bug, epic, or initiative -- each with its own structure, required fields, and quality checks. Use when the user asks to write a ticket, draft a user story, file a bug report, scope an epic, define an initiative, break work into subtasks, or convert a rough idea into a well-formed backlog item. Runs an interactive type selection and field-by-field questionnaire, then outputs a clean Markdown ticket ready to paste into Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues, Azure DevOps, or any tracker.

# Ticket Writer

Pick the right ticket type, then fill in only the fields that type demands. A story is not a bug; an epic is not an initiative. Each type has a distinct audience, scope, and definition of done -- mixing them produces vague, unactionable tickets that bloat backlogs.

## Core Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Type drives structure** | The type decides the required fields -- never use a single template for everything |
| **Outcomes over outputs** | Describe the change the work creates, not the activity performed |
| **Small enough to finish** | Stories and subtasks fit a sprint; epics fit a quarter; initiatives span multiple quarters |
| **Testable acceptance** | Every story, subtask, and bug has acceptance criteria that a reviewer can verify |
| **Context, not prose** | Prefer tables, lists, and labelled sections over paragraphs -- readers skim |
| **One ask per ticket** | If a ticket has two unrelated goals, split it |

## Type Hierarchy and Selection

Tickets form a hierarchy. Pick the highest level where the work still has a single, coherent purpose.

```
Initiative  (multi-quarter strategic outcome)
  Epic      (quarter-scale goal, one product area)
    Story   (sprint-scale user-visible value)
      Subtask  (implementation slice of a story)
    Bug     (defect against current behaviour)
    Issue   (anything else -- chore, spike, question)
```

### When to Use Each Type

| Type | Audience | Scope | Typical Duration | Key Question |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Initiative** | Execs, product leadership | Cross-team strategic goal | 1-4 quarters | What outcome do we want for the business or users? |
| **Epic** | Product, engineering, design | Single product area, multiple stories | 1 quarter | What capability or experience are we delivering? |
| **Story** | Dev team, QA, PM | One user-facing change | Fits in a sprint | As a [user], what can I now do? |
| **Subtask** | One developer | Technical slice of a story | Hours to 1-2 days | What specific implementation step does this cover? |
| **Bug** | Dev team, QA | A deviation from intended behaviour | Fix-sized | What is broken, and how do I reproduce it? |
| **Issue** | Dev team | Chore, spike, question, tech debt, docs | Variable | What needs attention that isn't user-facing work? |

### Type Decision Tree

1. Is this a deviation from intended behaviour? -> **Bug**
2. Is this a strategic goal spanning multiple teams or quarters? -> **Initiative**
3. Is this a large body of work that needs to be broken down but belongs to one product area? -> **Epic**
4. Is this user-visible value that fits in a sprint? -> **Story**
5. Is this an implementation slice of an existing story? -> **Subtask**
6. None of the above (chore, spike, investigation, tech debt, question)? -> **Issue**

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Type Selection

If the user provided a type as an argument, use it. Otherwise present a selectable menu (use `AskUserQuestion` or the platform's equivalent interactive prompt) listing the six types with their one-line descriptions from the table above. Never dump the full table as plain text -- keep the menu compact.

If the user's intent is clear from context (e.g., they said "write a bug report" or "create an epic for checkout redesign"), skip the menu and confirm the inferred type with a single yes/no prompt.

### Phase 2: Load the Type-Specific Reference

Read the matching reference file for the selected type:

| Type | Reference |
|---|---|
| Story | [references/story.md](references/story.md) |
| Subtask | [references/subtask.md](references/subtask.md) |
| Issue | [references/issue.md](references/issue.md) |
| Bug | [references/bug.md](references/bug.md) |
| Epic | [references/epic.md](references/epic.md) |
| Initiative | [references/initiative.md](references/initiative.md) |

Each reference contains:
- The required fields
- The optional fields
- A field-by-field questionnaire (questions, options, follow-ups)
- The output template
- Quality checks specific to that type

### Phase 3: Run the Questionnaire

Ask only the questions the reference lists for the selected type. Follow these rules:

1. **Batch compatible questions** (3-4 per prompt) when using an interactive menu tool. Use free-text prompts only when the answer is genuinely free-form (title, description, reproduction steps).
2. **Skip optional fields silently** if the user says "skip" or leaves them blank -- do not add empty placeholders.
3. **Follow-up on ambiguous answers** -- if the user says "it's slow", ask "slow compared to what, and by how much?"
4. **Never invent facts.** If the user cannot provide environment info, reproduction steps, or metrics, leave those fields out and note the gap in a `## Open Questions` section rather than fabricating values.

### Phase 4: Assemble the Ticket

Use the type's output template. Apply these universal formatting rules:

- **Title:** Imperative mood for stories/subtasks/issues ("Add password reset via email"), descriptive for bugs ("Payment confirmation email not sent after successful charge"), outcome-oriented for epics/initiatives ("Reduce checkout abandonment by 30%").
- **Body:** Markdown with section headings. No emojis unless the user explicitly requests them.
- **Labels:** Suggest labels based on type and content (e.g., `bug`, `severity:high`, `area:checkout`).
- **Links:** Leave placeholders for parent epic / related tickets / PRs rather than inventing IDs.

### Phase 5: Quality Check

Before showing the final output, run the checks listed in the type's reference file. Common failure modes to catch:

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Acceptance criteria describe implementation ("implement X service") | Rewrite in terms of observable outcomes ("when user does X, system does Y") |
| Bug has no steps to reproduce | Mark as "Open Questions" and ask the user to provide them |
| Epic has no success metric | Add a metric or downgrade to a story |
| Story doesn't name a user ("we need to...") | Rewrite with a concrete persona ("As a returning customer, I want...") |
| Initiative lists features instead of outcomes | Reframe key results as measurable changes, not shipped features |
| Subtask is larger than its parent story | Split the story or merge the subtasks |

### Phase 6: Deliver

Show the final ticket to the user in a code block so they can copy-paste it. Then offer:
1. Edit a field
2. Change the type (if the content no longer fits)
3. Write a related ticket (e.g., a story under the epic just written)
4. Done
