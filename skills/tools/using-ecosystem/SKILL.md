# Using Ecosystem

Discover the right skill, agent, or team for the situation at hand. This skill teaches a discovery PROCESS -- it does not maintain a hardcoded inventory. Every recommendation comes from scanning what is actually installed.

## Core Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Scan, don't guess** | Always scan installed skills/agents/teams before recommending. Never assume something is available. |
| **Match situation, not topic** | Pick the skill whose description triggers match what the user is doing, not the skill whose title loosely matches. |
| **Agents act, skills inform** | Skills are reference material. Agents are actors. Delegate work to an agent; consult a skill. |
| **Teams for multi-role work** | If the work needs 3+ agents coordinating, check for a pre-composed team before assembling ad-hoc. |
| **Narrower wins** | If two skills overlap, pick the one with the tighter trigger match. |
| **Chain when work crosses domains** | Multi-step tasks often need two or three agents in sequence. |

---

## Step 1: Scan What Is Installed

Run the discovery commands from [discovery-commands](references/discovery-commands.md) to build a live index of installed skills, agents, and teams. Read each frontmatter `name` and `description` field.

Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT recommend from memory. The installed set varies per user and per project.

---

## Step 2: Classify the User's Situation

Determine what the user needs:

| Signal | Category |
|---|---|
| Needs reference material, patterns, or principles | **Knowledge skill** |
| Needs to generate a specific output (ticket, PR message, report, rules file) | **Tool skill** |
| Needs to follow a step-by-step operational procedure | **Playbook skill** |
| Needs framework-specific component reference | **Framework skill** |
| Needs a single focused task done (investigate, review, implement) | **Specialist agent** |
| Needs ongoing domain ownership (requirements, architecture, QA) | **Role agent** |
| Needs coordinated multi-agent delivery (feature, release, review cycle) | **Team** |

---

## Step 3: Match and Recommend

### Decision Tree

```
User request
   |
   v
Does it need multiple agents coordinating?
   +-- Yes --> Scan teams/ for a matching team
   |            +-- Found --> Recommend the team
   |            +-- None  --> Assemble ad-hoc from agents (see chaining below)
   |
   +-- No --> Is it a well-scoped actionable task?
               +-- Yes --> Scan agents/ for a matching specialist or role
               +-- No  --> Scan skills/ for a matching skill
                            Use the category signals from Step 2
```

### Matching Rules

1. **Read the `description` field** of each candidate. Match on trigger phrases, not the name.
2. **Prefer the narrower skill.** `database-design` beats `clean-architecture` for a schema question.
3. **Check `user-invocable`** -- if the user wants to run something interactively, only recommend user-invocable skills.
4. **Skills stack.** You can recommend multiple knowledge skills for one task (e.g., `security` + `solid` for a security review).
5. **Never recommend what is not installed.** If a skill would fit but is not present, suggest installing it with `npx skills add`.

---

## Step 4: Chain When Needed

When a single skill or agent is not enough, chain them. Common patterns:

| Pattern | Shape |
|---|---|
| **Investigation flow** | Read-only agent --> Design agent --> Implementation agent --> Review agent |
| **Feature flow** | Requirements role --> Architecture role --> Dev roles (parallel) --> QA role |
| **Review flow** | Smell scanner --> Reviewer --> (optional) Implementer for fixes |
| **Coverage flow** | Test gap analyzer --> Implementer --> Reviewer |

These are guidelines, not rituals. Skip steps that do not apply. Add steps that do. If a pre-composed team matches the chain, use the team instead.

## Ecosystem Structure

The ecosystem has five layers. The structure is stable -- it does not change when skills are added.

| Layer | Location | Format | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Skills** | `skills/{category}/{name}/SKILL.md` | Markdown + YAML frontmatter | Reference material, tools, playbooks, roles, frameworks |
| **Agents** | `agents/{name}.md` | Markdown + YAML frontmatter | Specialist and role sub-agents |
| **Teams** | `teams/{name}.md` | Markdown + YAML frontmatter | Pre-composed agent teams with coordination protocols |
| **Specs** | `spec/*.md` | Markdown | Format specifications for skills, agents, teams, plugins |
| **Plugins** | `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | JSON | Distribution bundles grouping skills and agents |

### Skill Categories

| Category | Path | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| Knowledge | `skills/knowledge/` | Auto-loaded when relevant |
| Tools | `skills/tools/` | User-invocable slash commands |
| Playbooks | `skills/playbooks/` | User-invocable slash commands |
| Roles | `skills/roles/` | Auto-loaded by matching role agents |
| Frameworks | `skills/frameworks/{name}/` | Loaded when the framework is in play |

### Agent Tiers

| Tier | Scope | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Specialist | Single repeatable task (stateless) | investigator, reviewer, refactor-scout |
| Role | Domain of responsibility (some carry memory) | architect, backend-dev, qa-engineer |

### Team Spawning Modes

| Mode | When | How |
|---|---|---|
| Peer | Platform supports agent-to-agent messaging | Lead creates team, teammates claim tasks and message each other |
| Sequential | All other platforms | Lead dispatches one sub-agent per phase, passes outputs forward |

## Quality Checklist

Before answering a "which skill/agent/team" question:

- [ ] Did I scan installed skills/agents/teams rather than recommending from memory?
- [ ] Did I match on the description's trigger phrases, not just the name?
- [ ] Did I consider whether a narrower, more specific skill exists?
- [ ] Did I recommend an agent when the work is actionable, not just reference material?
- [ ] Did I check for a pre-composed team when the work needs 3+ agents?
- [ ] Did I mention chaining when the work crosses domains?
- [ ] Did I avoid recommending something that is not installed?

---

## Critical Rules

1. **Scan first.** Every recommendation starts with a live scan of what is installed. No hardcoded lists.
2. **Situation over title.** Match what the user is doing, not what the skill is called.
3. **Specialist for scoped tasks, role for domain work, team for multi-role delivery.**
4. **Chain over stretch.** If a single skill does not cover the work, combine two. Do not force one skill beyond its fit.
5. **Never recommend uninstalled skills as available.** Suggest installing with a hint, not as a next step.
6. **Respect agent boundaries.** Read-only agents do not edit files. Dev agents run in worktrees.
7. **Category is a signal.** Tools for interactive output, playbooks for procedures, knowledge for reference.
