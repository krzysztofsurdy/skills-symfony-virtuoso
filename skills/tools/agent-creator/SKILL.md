name: agent-creator
description: Interactive tool to design a well-scoped sub-agent definition -- specialist, role, or team-lead -- with the right frontmatter, tool permissions, isolation, memory, and system prompt. Use when the user asks to create a sub-agent, write an agent file, design a specialized worker, scaffold a role agent, bootstrap an agent team, or turn a repeated delegation pattern into a reusable agent. Runs a six-phase questionnaire and outputs a ready-to-commit agent markdown file plus marketplace registration.

# Agent Creator

Create a sub-agent that earns its context window. Most agents fail not because the model is weak but because the definition is vague -- unclear trigger, sprawling tool list, a body that mixes persona and procedure, and no output contract. This skill walks you through a six-phase design so the resulting agent is focused, least-privileged, and predictable.

## Core Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **One job, one agent** | An agent that does two things does neither well. Split the responsibility before writing. |
| **Least privilege** | Grant the smallest tool set that lets the agent finish its job. Read-only by default. |
| **Trigger-first description** | The `description` field is the only thing read before delegation. Pack it with keywords and "when to use". |
| **Contract over conversation** | Define explicit input, process, and output. Agents are not chat sessions. |
| **Isolation when writing** | If the agent edits files, run it in a worktree so the orchestrator can review before merging. |
| **Portable body, platform frontmatter** | Keep the system prompt agent-agnostic. Adapt frontmatter fields per target platform. |

## Agent vs Skill -- Quick Disambiguation

Before creating an agent, confirm it is the right primitive.

| Use a Skill | Use an Agent |
|---|---|
| Reference material (patterns, checklists, schemas) | Work to perform (investigate, review, implement) |
| Loaded into an existing session | Runs in its own context window |
| Passive knowledge | Active actor with tools and a workflow |
| "Where do I learn about X" | "Do X for me and return a result" |

If the answer is reference material, stop and use the `skill-creator` skill instead. If the answer is work, continue.

## Archetype Selection

Agents fall into three archetypes. Pick one before designing.

| Archetype | Scope | Memory | Modifies files | Typical examples |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Specialist** | Single, repeatable task type | Stateless | Rarely (doc writer, implementer) | Investigator, Reviewer, Refactor Scout, Dependency Auditor, Test Gap Analyzer |
| **Role** | Entire domain of responsibility | Often persistent (project-level) | Dev roles yes, others no | Product Manager, Architect, Backend Dev, QA Engineer, Project Manager |
| **Team-Lead** | Coordinates multiple workers in parallel | Shared task list | No (delegates) | Orchestrator, release-train lead, review dispatcher |

### Decision tree

1. Does the agent do **one repeatable task type** (review this PR, investigate this area, audit dependencies)? -> **Specialist**
2. Does the agent **own a domain** across many task types and benefit from remembering context across sessions (requirements, architecture decisions, risk register)? -> **Role**
3. Does the agent need to **spawn and coordinate other agents** working in parallel (research teams, multi-layer refactors)? -> **Team-Lead**

If the user provided an archetype as an argument, use it. Otherwise present a selectable menu using `AskUserQuestion` (or the platform's equivalent interactive prompt) with the three options from the table above.

See [references/archetypes.md](references/archetypes.md) for worked examples of each archetype and the anti-patterns to avoid.

## Workflow

This skill uses **guided phases** -- each phase is a separate file loaded one at a time. Every phase ends with a gate where you must wait for user confirmation before proceeding. Do not skip phases or merge them.

| Phase | File | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Purpose and Trigger](phases/01-purpose-and-trigger.md) | What the agent does, when to delegate, out-of-scope, output shape, archetype |
| 2 | [Name and Identity](phases/02-name-and-identity.md) | Kebab-case name, collision check, user confirmation |
| 3 | [Capabilities](phases/03-capabilities.md) | Tool permissions, isolation, memory, preloaded skills |
| 4 | [System Prompt](phases/04-system-prompt.md) | Five-section contract: Input, Process, Rules, Output |
| 5 | [Placement and Scope](phases/05-placement-and-scope.md) | Where the file lives: project, personal, plugin, session |
| 6 | [Validate and Write](phases/06-validate-and-write.md) | Checklist, file creation, marketplace registration |

**Start by loading Phase 1.** After the user confirms each phase, load the next. Never load multiple phases at once. Never skip a phase.
