# Agent Frontmatter Fields

Frontmatter is the only metadata read before the agent is invoked. Treat it as a contract with the orchestrator: `name` identifies the agent, `description` triggers delegation, and the rest shapes what happens once the agent runs.

## Portability

Only three fields are portable across agent platforms:

| Portable | Platform-specific |
|---|---|
| `name` | `tools`, `disallowedTools` |
| `description` | `model`, `isolation`, `memory` |
| `skills` | `mcpServers`, `hooks`, `permissionMode` |
|  | `color`, `effort`, `background`, `maxTurns` |

Write the body to be portable. Adapt platform-specific frontmatter when moving the agent between platforms.

## Field Reference

### `name` (required)

A unique kebab-case identifier. Matches the filename without the `.md` extension.

```yaml
name: migration-planner
```

Rules:

- Lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only
- Start with a letter
- Describe the role, not the task (`reviewer`, not `review-this-pr`)
- Keep it short (one or two hyphenated words is ideal)

### `description` (required)

The only field read during delegation decisions. Make every word earn its place.

Format: `{what it does}. {when to delegate}.`

Good:

```yaml
description: Read-only deep exploration of a specific codebase area. Delegate when you need structured investigation of how something works, where something is used, or what a subsystem does.
```

Bad:

```yaml
description: An agent that helps with code.
```

Patterns that work:

- Include trigger phrases the orchestrator can match ("delegate when", "use after", "invoke for")
- Name the output shape when it is a key differentiator ("returns prioritised findings with severity")
- Mention constraints that prevent mis-use ("read-only", "runs in a worktree")

Avoid:

- Marketing adjectives ("powerful", "comprehensive", "advanced")
- Redundant self-reference ("this agent is an agent that...")
- Anything the orchestrator cannot verify from the description alone

### `tools` (platform-specific, strongly recommended)

An allowlist of tools the agent can use. Omitting it inherits everything from the caller -- rarely what you want.

```yaml
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
```

See [tool-selection.md](tool-selection.md) for per-archetype defaults and the decision tree.

### `disallowedTools` (platform-specific, optional)

A denylist applied before the allowlist resolves. Useful when you want "everything except writes":

```yaml
disallowedTools: Write, Edit
```

If both `tools` and `disallowedTools` are set, the denylist wins for overlapping entries.

### `skills` (portable, optional)

Skills whose content is injected into the agent's context at startup. Sub-agents do not inherit skills from the caller -- you must list them explicitly.

```yaml
skills:
  - clean-architecture
  - design-patterns
  - api-design
```

Rules:

- Reference skills by `name`, not path
- Include one to four skills; more is usually wasted context
- Only include skills the agent actively needs for its workflow

### `model` (platform-specific, optional, discouraged)

Do not hardcode provider-specific model identifiers in shared agent definitions. Model selection is a user or platform concern.

If you must set it (e.g. for a local personal agent that should always use a fast model):

```yaml
model: haiku
```

For distributable agents (marketplace, team-shared, plugin), omit the field entirely and let the caller or platform decide.

### `isolation` (platform-specific, optional)

Set to `worktree` when the agent creates or modifies source code. The agent operates on a temporary copy of the repository, and the orchestrator reviews changes before merging.

```yaml
isolation: worktree
```

Leave unset for read-only agents.

### `memory` (platform-specific, optional)

Gives the agent a persistent directory that survives across sessions.

```yaml
memory: project
```

Scopes:

| Scope | Use when |
|---|---|
| `user` | Agent should remember learnings across all your projects |
| `project` | Agent's knowledge is project-specific and shareable via version control |
| `local` | Agent's knowledge is project-specific but should not be committed |

`project` is the default for role agents that accumulate context.

### `mcpServers` (platform-specific, optional)

Gives the agent access to MCP servers the main conversation does not have. Useful for tools that should stay scoped to this one agent (e.g. a Playwright server for a browser-testing agent).

```yaml
mcpServers:
  - playwright:
      type: stdio
      command: npx
      args: ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"]
  - github
```

### `permissionMode` (platform-specific, optional)

Overrides how the agent handles permission prompts. Use sparingly -- a permissive mode inside a sub-agent undermines the caller's safety posture.

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `default` | Standard permission prompts |
| `acceptEdits` | Auto-accept file edits in the working directory |
| `plan` | Read-only plan mode |
| `bypassPermissions` | Skip prompts -- use with great care |

### `hooks` (platform-specific, optional)

Lifecycle hooks scoped to this agent. Common uses: enforce tests pass before the agent goes idle, block certain tool calls pre-execution.

### `maxTurns` (platform-specific, optional)

Cap on the number of agentic turns before the agent stops. Useful for agents that can loop -- a reviewer that keeps finding "one more thing".

### `color`, `effort`, `background`, `initialPrompt` (platform-specific, optional)

UX and runtime conveniences. Omit unless you have a specific need.

## Field Combinations to Validate

| Combination | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `isolation: worktree` without any write tools | Agent cannot actually modify anything -- remove the isolation |
| `Write`/`Edit` in `tools` without `isolation: worktree` | Agent edits the main tree -- risky for team-shared agents |
| `memory: project` on a stateless specialist | Wasted complexity -- remove the memory field |
| `skills` list longer than four entries | Context bloat -- trim to the essentials |
| `model` hardcoded in a distributable agent | Non-portable -- remove it |
| `permissionMode: bypassPermissions` on anything shared | Safety risk -- justify or remove |
