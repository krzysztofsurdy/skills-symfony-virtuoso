# Platforms

Agent platforms differ in frontmatter fields, file locations, and how agents interact. This reference covers the ones most relevant when authoring portable agent definitions.

## Scope and Priority

Most platforms support multiple scopes for agent definitions. When names collide, the higher-priority scope wins.

| Scope | Use for | Commit to repo? |
|---|---|---|
| Managed / organisation | Org-wide agents deployed by admins | Yes (in managed settings repo) |
| Session / CLI-flag | One-off testing, automation scripts | No -- ephemeral |
| Project | Agents specific to this codebase | Yes |
| User / personal | Personal agents reused across projects | No (user home directory) |
| Plugin / marketplace | Agents shipped as distributable bundles | Yes (in plugin repo) |

Project scope is the right default for team-shared work. Personal scope is for individual preferences. Plugin scope is for redistribution.

## Claude Code

### Scope paths

| Scope | Path |
|---|---|
| Project | `.claude/agents/<name>.md` |
| User | `~/.claude/agents/<name>.md` |
| Plugin | Inside the plugin's `agents/` directory |
| Managed | `.claude/agents/` inside the managed settings directory |
| CLI | Passed via `--agents '{...}'` as JSON |

Project agents are discovered by walking up from the working directory. Restart the session or use `/agents` to load manually-added files.

### Frontmatter

All fields listed in [frontmatter-fields.md](frontmatter-fields.md) are supported. Plugin agents do not support `hooks`, `mcpServers`, or `permissionMode` for security reasons -- copy the agent to `.claude/agents/` if you need those.

### Interaction

- The orchestrator delegates by matching the agent's description against the task
- A sub-agent runs in its own context window and returns only its output
- Sub-agents cannot spawn other sub-agents (prevents infinite nesting)
- Agents running as the main thread (`claude --agent`) can spawn sub-agents via the `Agent(...)` tool

### Agent teams (experimental)

Claude Code also supports agent teams, where multiple teammates run in parallel and communicate with each other. Teammates can reference sub-agent definitions by name, inheriting their `tools` and `model`. When a sub-agent definition runs as a teammate:

- The definition's body is appended to the teammate system prompt as additional instructions, not as a replacement
- `skills` and `mcpServers` are not applied -- the teammate loads them from project and user settings
- Team coordination tools remain available even when `tools` restricts others

If you want the same agent to work both as a sub-agent and as a teammate, keep the body self-contained and do not assume tools outside the allowlist are present.

## Cursor

Cursor uses a different model -- it is primarily an AI coding editor rather than a sub-agent orchestrator. There is no direct sub-agent equivalent, but Cursor supports:

- Rules files (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) for project-wide instructions
- Custom modes for different behaviours per session

If you want to bring a sub-agent definition into Cursor, convert it into a rules file by:

1. Dropping the frontmatter except for `description`
2. Writing the body as a `## [Agent Name] Mode` section in the rules file
3. Adding the trigger condition as guidance for when to apply that mode

See the `agentic-rules-writer` skill for producing these conversions.

## Codex / AGENTS.md Convention

The `AGENTS.md` convention (used by OpenAI Codex and several other agents) is a single Markdown file at the project root that contains all agent-related guidance. It is not a sub-agent registry in the Claude Code sense -- it is a flat document.

To port a sub-agent definition to an `AGENTS.md`-driven platform:

1. Add a `## [Agent Name]` section to `AGENTS.md`
2. Copy the role statement, Input, Process, Rules, and Output under that section
3. Note the trigger condition from the original `description` as the section's first paragraph

## Generic / Plain-Markdown Platforms

Many platforms (Windsurf, Copilot, Gemini CLI, Cline, Continue, Trae, Roo Code, Amp, Goose, Augment, Kilo Code) read a single plain-Markdown instructions file. To use a sub-agent definition there:

1. Flatten the frontmatter -- keep only the portable `name`, `description`, and body
2. Write the body as a section in the instructions file
3. Describe how the user should invoke the agent ("When you want an investigation, say 'investigate X'")

This loses the delegation and context-isolation benefits, but preserves the structured prompt.

## Inter-Agent Communication

### Sub-agent model (most platforms)

- The caller delegates with a prompt
- The sub-agent works in its own context
- The sub-agent returns output
- The caller integrates it

Sub-agents do not talk to each other.

### Agent-team model (Claude Code experimental, similar multi-agent frameworks)

- A lead coordinates multiple teammates
- Teammates can message each other directly
- Shared task lists coordinate work
- Each teammate is a full, independent session

Design for sub-agent mode by default. Escalate to team mode only when parallel exploration or adversarial debate adds real value -- the token cost is significantly higher.

## Porting Checklist

Before distributing an agent across platforms:

- [ ] Body is platform-portable (no tool names, no provider-specific phrasing)
- [ ] Tool permissions expressed in frontmatter, not duplicated in the body
- [ ] Description has trigger phrases the target platform will actually match
- [ ] `model` omitted (users configure it per platform)
- [ ] Isolation and memory documented in the agent's README if you ship one
- [ ] File name matches the `name` frontmatter field

## Marketplace / Plugin Distribution

If you ship the agent as part of a plugin or marketplace bundle, also consider:

- Registering the agent in the plugin's manifest (`marketplace.json`, `plugin.json`, or equivalent)
- Versioning the plugin when the agent changes (patch for content, minor for new agent, major for breaking)
- Updating the plugin's README to list the agent and its purpose
- Pairing the agent with any skills it preloads, so installing the plugin makes both available
