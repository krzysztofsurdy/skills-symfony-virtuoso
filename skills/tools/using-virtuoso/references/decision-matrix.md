# Decision Matrix

Situation-to-skill and situation-to-agent lookups. Use when you need to pick the right piece of the ecosystem for a specific moment.

## By Work Phase

| Apply a refactoring with TDD | `refactoring` + `solid` + `implementer` agent |
| Security review | `security` knowledge + `reviewer` agent |
| Accessibility audit | `accessibility` knowledge + manual audit |

## By Design Task

| Task | Use |
|---|---|
| Pick a design pattern | `design-patterns` knowledge |
| Pick an architecture style | `clean-architecture` + `microservices` knowledge |

| Design a GraphQL schema | `api-design` knowledge (GraphQL section) + `architect` role |
| Model a database schema | `database-design` knowledge |
| Plan a data migration | `database-migration` playbook + `migration-planner` agent |

## By Delivery / Process Task

| Task | Use |
|---|---|
| Sprint planning | `scrum` knowledge + `scrum-master` role |
| Write a sprint goal | `scrum` knowledge (sprint goal section) |
| Run a retrospective | `scrum-master` role |

| Risk register | `project-manager` role |

## By Framework or Upgrade Task

| Task | Use |
|---|---|
| Build something in Symfony | `symfony-components` |
| Upgrade a Symfony major | `symfony-upgrade` playbook |
| Build something in Django | `django-components` |
| Build a LangChain agent | `langchain-components` |
| Upgrade PHP itself | `php-upgrade` playbook |
| Update Composer dependencies | `composer-dependencies` playbook |

## By Ecosystem Authoring Task

| Task | Use |
|---|---|
| Create a new skill | `skill-creator` tool |
| Create a new agent definition | `agent-creator` tool |
| Package a plugin | `plugin-creator` tool |
| Write an agent rules file | `agentic-rules-writer` tool |
| Discover available skills | `find-skills` tool |
| Get oriented to the ecosystem | `using-virtuoso` (this skill) |

## Tie-Breaking

When two skills both look like they fit:

1. **Pick the narrower one.** `database-design` beats `api-design` for schema questions even if the schema is exposed via an API.
2. **Pick the one with matching triggers.** The frontmatter `description` contains trigger phrases — check which one matches the user's actual words.
3. **If one is a playbook and the other is knowledge, the playbook is for executing and the knowledge is for deciding.** Choose based on whether the user is deciding or doing.
4. **If still tied, pick the more recently updated skill** — newer content is usually more precise.
