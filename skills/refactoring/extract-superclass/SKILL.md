description: Eliminate code duplication by extracting common functionality from multiple classes into a shared superclass
---

## Overview

Extract Superclass is a refactoring technique that consolidates duplicate code and shared functionality from multiple classes into a single parent class. When two or more classes share common fields and methods, creating a superclass allows you to move this duplicated code to one location, improving maintainability and reducing code duplication.

## Motivation

Code duplication often appears when classes perform similar tasks. Rather than allowing this duplication to persist and become harder to maintain, Extract Superclass provides a structured approach to consolidate shared functionality through inheritance. This is especially useful when you discover parallel development has created similar implementations across your codebase.

Benefits of recognizing and refactoring duplicate code early:
- Reduces maintenance burden by centralizing changes
- Makes relationships between classes explicit
- Improves code readability and understanding
- Establishes a foundation for future shared functionality

## Mechanics

The refactoring process follows these steps:

1. **Create a superclass** - Establish a new abstract parent class
2. **Move fields upward** - Use Pull Up Field to move common attributes to the superclass first
3. **Move methods upward** - Use Pull Up Method to migrate shared methods
4. **Move constructors** - Use Pull Up Constructor Body to consolidate initialization logic
5. **Update client code** - Replace direct subclass references with the superclass where appropriate

The order matters: move fields before methods since methods may depend on fields.

## Before and After

### Before: Duplicate Code in Two Classes

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

class Employee
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly string $name,
        private readonly string $email,
        private readonly float $salary
    ) {}

    public function getName(): string
    {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function getEmail(): string
    {
        return $this->email;
    }

    public function calculateTax(): float
    {
        return $this->salary * 0.2;
    }
}

class Contractor
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly string $name,
        private readonly string $email,
        private readonly float $hourlyRate
    ) {}

    public function getName(): string
    {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function getEmail(): string
    {
        return $this->email;
    }

    public function calculateTax(): float
    {
        return $this->hourlyRate * 40 * 52 * 0.15;
    }
}
```

### After: Extracted Superclass

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

abstract class Person
{
    public function __construct(
        protected readonly string $name,
        protected readonly string $email
    ) {}

    public function getName(): string
    {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function getEmail(): string
    {
        return $this->email;
    }

    abstract public function calculateTax(): float;
}

final class Employee extends Person
{
    public function __construct(
        string $name,
        string $email,
        private readonly float $salary
    ) {
        parent::__construct($name, $email);
    }

    public function calculateTax(): float
    {
        return $this->salary * 0.2;
    }
}

final class Contractor extends Person
{
    public function __construct(
        string $name,
        string $email,
        private readonly float $hourlyRate
    ) {
        parent::__construct($name, $email);
    }

    public function calculateTax(): float
    {
        return $this->hourlyRate * 40 * 52 * 0.15;
    }
}
```

## Benefits

- **Eliminates Duplication** - Common code exists in a single location, reducing maintenance overhead
- **Improves Maintainability** - Changes to shared behavior only need to be made once
- **Clarifies Relationships** - The inheritance hierarchy makes class relationships explicit
- **Supports Extension** - The abstract superclass provides a foundation for new subclasses
- **Enables Polymorphism** - Client code can work with the superclass, allowing flexible implementations

## When NOT to Use

- **Multiple Inheritance Conflicts** - If subclasses already inherit from different superclasses, multiple inheritance may not be the solution
- **Unrelated Classes** - Force-fitting unrelated classes into a hierarchy creates artificial relationships
- **Composition is Better** - Some shared functionality may be better handled through composition and dependency injection
- **Single Class** - If only one class uses the functionality, extraction isn't necessary
- **Conflicting Semantics** - If the shared code has different meanings in different contexts, a superclass may confuse intent

## Related Refactorings

- **Extract Interface** - Create an interface instead when defining a contract rather than sharing implementation
- **Extract Subclass** - The inverse operation; extract specialized behavior into subclasses
- **Pull Up Field/Method** - Individual steps in the Extract Superclass process
- **Move Method** - Move functionality between classes without creating a hierarchy
