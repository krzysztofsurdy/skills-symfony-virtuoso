description: Extract duplicate constructor initialization code from subclasses into a superclass constructor to eliminate code duplication and improve consistency
---

## Overview

Pull Up Constructor Body is a refactoring technique that eliminates duplicate initialization logic in subclass constructors by extracting common code into a superclass constructor. This addresses the code smell where subclasses contain constructors with largely identical code, improving maintainability and reducing duplication across an inheritance hierarchy.

## Motivation

When multiple subclasses have constructors that perform similar initialization steps, this creates several problems:

- **Code duplication**: Changes to common initialization logic must be made in multiple places
- **Consistency risks**: Updates in one subclass constructor might be missed in others
- **Maintenance burden**: More code to maintain and test
- **Confusion**: Developers may not realize the duplicated logic exists across classes

By pulling up the common constructor body to the superclass, you create a single source of truth for initialization logic shared across the hierarchy.

## Mechanics

The refactoring follows these steps:

1. **Analyze subclass constructors** - Identify identical or nearly identical initialization code across subclasses
2. **Create superclass constructor** - Define a new constructor in the parent class that contains the shared logic
3. **Determine parameters** - Include only parameters the superclass genuinely needs (subclasses may have additional parameters)
4. **Call parent constructor** - Update each subclass constructor to call the superclass constructor as the first statement using `parent::__construct()`
5. **Remove duplicate code** - Delete the now-redundant initialization code from subclass constructors
6. **Test thoroughly** - Verify that all subclass instantiation behavior remains identical

## Before/After (PHP 8.3+ Code)

### Before - Duplicate Constructor Logic

```php
abstract class Vehicle
{
    protected string $brand;
    protected string $color;
    protected float $price;
}

class Car extends Vehicle
{
    private int $doors;

    public function __construct(
        string $brand,
        string $color,
        float $price,
        int $doors
    ) {
        $this->brand = $brand;
        $this->color = $color;
        $this->price = $price;
        $this->doors = $doors;
    }
}

class Motorcycle extends Vehicle
{
    private bool $hasSidecar;

    public function __construct(
        string $brand,
        string $color,
        float $price,
        bool $hasSidecar
    ) {
        $this->brand = $brand;
        $this->color = $color;
        $this->price = $price;
        $this->hasSidecar = $hasSidecar;
    }
}
```

### After - Common Logic in Superclass

```php
abstract class Vehicle
{
    protected string $brand;
    protected string $color;
    protected float $price;

    public function __construct(
        string $brand,
        string $color,
        float $price
    ) {
        $this->brand = $brand;
        $this->color = $color;
        $this->price = $price;
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle
{
    private int $doors;

    public function __construct(
        string $brand,
        string $color,
        float $price,
        int $doors
    ) {
        parent::__construct($brand, $color, $price);
        $this->doors = $doors;
    }
}

class Motorcycle extends Vehicle
{
    private bool $hasSidecar;

    public function __construct(
        string $brand,
        string $color,
        float $price,
        bool $hasSidecar
    ) {
        parent::__construct($brand, $color, $price);
        $this->hasSidecar = $hasSidecar;
    }
}
```

## Benefits

- **Eliminates duplication** - Single source of truth for shared initialization logic
- **Improves consistency** - Ensures all subclasses initialize inherited properties identically
- **Reduces maintenance burden** - Changes to common initialization happen in one place
- **Enhances readability** - Intent is clearer with separated concerns
- **Simplifies testing** - Easier to verify parent class behavior is consistent
- **Strengthens hierarchy** - Makes the inheritance relationship more explicit

## When NOT to Use

- **Minimal duplication** - If only one or two lines are duplicated, consider keeping them separate
- **Fundamentally different initialization** - If subclasses initialize parent properties in substantially different ways, duplication may indicate a design problem better solved with composition
- **Conditional logic complexity** - If pulling up creates overly complex conditional logic in the parent constructor, this is a code smell
- **Parameter misalignment** - If subclasses require entirely different parameters, pulling up may hide design issues
- **Interface contracts** - If constructors are meant to signal different contracts to clients, keep them separate

## Related Refactorings

- **Pull Up Method** - Similar concept applied to regular methods rather than constructors
- **Extract Superclass** - Often used in conjunction when creating new common parent classes
- **Replace Constructor with Factory Method** - Alternative for complex initialization logic
- **Move Method** - For moving constructor logic to utility classes instead of up the hierarchy
