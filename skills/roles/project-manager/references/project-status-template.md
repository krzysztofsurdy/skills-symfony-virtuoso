## Status Report Writing Guidelines

### Leading with Bad News

| Do | Do Not |
|---|---|
| "Sprint is 3 days behind due to API integration complexity" | "Things are going well overall" (when they are not) |
| "Risk X has materialized; mitigation plan below" | "There are some minor issues we are working through" |
| State the impact, then the mitigation | Minimize or defer bad news to a later report |

### RAG Status Guidelines

**Schedule**:
- Green: Forecast completion is within the planned date +/- tolerance
- Amber: Forecast completion is approaching tolerance boundary
- Red: Forecast completion exceeds tolerance; exception report required

**Scope**:
- Green: All planned deliverables are on track
- Amber: Some deliverables are at risk of being deferred
- Red: P0 deliverables are at risk or have been descoped without approval

**Quality**:
- Green: Test pass rate meets target; no open P0/P1 bugs
- Amber: Test pass rate below target or open P1 bugs pending
- Red: Open P0 bugs or quality metrics significantly below target

### Report Frequency Guide

| Project Size | Report Frequency | Report Depth |
|---|---|---|
| Small (1-2 weeks) | Daily standup summary | Bullet points |
| Medium (2-8 weeks) | Weekly highlight report | Full template |
| Large (2+ months) | Weekly highlights + monthly detailed report | Full template + trend analysis |

### Audience Adaptation

| Audience | Focus On | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| **Project board / executives** | Status, risks, decisions needed, milestones | Technical details, implementation specifics |
| **Development team** | Blockers, priorities, scope clarification | Business justification, budget details |
| **Stakeholders** | Deliverable progress, timeline impact | Internal team issues, technical debt |
