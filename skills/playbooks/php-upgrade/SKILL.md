description: Step-by-step PHP version upgrade playbook for PHP 8.0 through 8.4+ with automated tooling. Use when the user asks to upgrade PHP to a new version, check PHP compatibility, fix deprecation warnings, run Rector for automated refactoring, audit code with PHPCompatibility, or plan a PHP migration strategy. Covers breaking changes per version, php.ini configuration updates, extension compatibility, Rector rule sets, testing strategies, and the changelog-first upgrade workflow.

# PHP Version Upgrade

Upgrade one minor version at a time. Never skip versions -- each step surfaces deprecations that become errors in the next release. Every upgrade follows the same cycle: audit, automate, test, deploy.

## Core Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Changelog first** | Before any upgrade, search the web for the official PHP migration guide (php.net/migration) or ask the user for the changelog -- never rely on static knowledge alone |
| **One version at a time** | Upgrade 8.1 -> 8.2 -> 8.3 -> 8.4 sequentially -- skipping versions makes it impossible to isolate breakage |
| **Fix deprecations before upgrading** | Deprecations in version N become errors in version N+1 -- treat them as mandatory fixes |
| **Automate first, manual second** | Run Rector and PHPCompatibility before touching code by hand -- they catch 80%+ of required changes |
| **Prove it with tests** | Never consider an upgrade complete without a passing test suite on the target version |
| **Pin your platform** | Set `config.platform.php` in `composer.json` to match your lowest deployment target |

---

## Upgrade Process Overview

### Phase 0: Read the Changelog

Before touching any code, obtain the actual changelog for the target PHP version:

1. **Search the web** for `PHP X.Y migration guide` (e.g., `PHP 8.4 migration guide php.net`)
2. **Or ask the user** to provide the changelog / release notes
3. **Read the official migration page** at `https://www.php.net/manual/en/migrationXY.php`

This is non-negotiable. Each version has unique changes that static skill knowledge cannot fully capture.

### Phase 1: Audit

Before changing any code, understand the scope of the upgrade.

1. **Run PHPCompatibility** against the target version to identify incompatible code
2. **Run php-parallel-lint** with the target PHP binary to catch syntax errors
3. **Run `composer outdated`** to check if all dependencies support the target version
4. **Review the official migration guide** at php.net for the target version
5. **Check PHP extensions** for compatibility (`ext-intl`, `ext-mbstring`, etc.)

### Phase 2: Automate

Use Rector to handle the bulk of code transformations automatically.

```php
// rector.php
use Rector\Config\RectorConfig;

return RectorConfig::configure()
    ->withPaths([__DIR__ . '/src', __DIR__ . '/tests'])
    ->withPhpSets(php84: true);  // adjust to target version
```

Always dry-run first:

```bash
vendor/bin/rector process --dry-run
```

Review changes, then apply:

```bash
vendor/bin/rector process
```

Commit Rector changes separately from manual fixes for clean git history.

### Phase 3: Update Dependencies

1. Update `composer.json` with the new PHP version constraint: `"php": ">=8.4"`
2. Update `config.platform.php` to match the target version
3. Run `composer update` and resolve conflicts
4. Update PHP extensions as needed

### Phase 4: Test and Deploy

1. Run the full test suite under the new PHP version
2. Run static analysis (PHPStan/Psalm)
3. Deploy to staging and verify
4. Monitor production logs for deprecation notices after deployment

See [Upgrade Process Reference](references/upgrade-process.md) for detailed tool configuration, CI pipeline setup, and Docker considerations.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Rector** | Automated AST-based code transformation | First step after auditing -- handles most mechanical changes |
| **PHPCompatibility** | PHP_CodeSniffer ruleset for cross-version compatibility | Audit phase -- identifies all incompatible code before you start |
| **php-parallel-lint** | Parallel syntax checking (~20x faster than serial) | Audit phase -- catches syntax errors under the new version |
| **PHPStan/Psalm** | Static analysis | Verification phase -- catches type errors after transformation |
| **symfony/phpunit-bridge** | Deprecation summary in test output | Ongoing -- monitors deprecation count during upgrades |

## Breaking Changes by Version

| Transition | Key Breaking Changes |
|---|---|
| **8.0 -> 8.1** | Fibers introduced, enums added, readonly properties, intersection types, `never` return type |
| **8.1 -> 8.2** | Dynamic properties deprecated (use `#[AllowDynamicProperties]` temporarily), `$GLOBALS` access restrictions, readonly classes, disjunctive normal form types |
| **8.2 -> 8.3** | Typed class constants, `json_validate()` added, `#[Override]` attribute, `Randomizer` additions, date/time exception changes |
| **8.3 -> 8.4** | Implicit nullable types deprecated (`function foo(string $bar = null)` must become `?string $bar = null`), property hooks, asymmetric visibility, `new` without parentheses deprecated for no-arg constructors, DOM extension namespace changes |

See [Version Changes Reference](references/version-changes.md) for complete per-version details with code examples.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It Hurts | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| Skipping versions | Cannot isolate which changes broke what | Always upgrade one version at a time |
| Ignoring deprecation warnings | Deprecations become fatal errors in the next version | Fix all deprecations before upgrading |
| Not checking dependencies | Third-party packages may not support the target version | Run `composer outdated` and check support before starting |
| Using `--ignore-platform-reqs` | Bypasses safety checks, causes runtime errors | Never use it -- fix the actual constraints instead |
| Not pinning `config.platform.php` | Local PHP differs from production, causing install mismatches | Always set it to match production |
| Large unreviewed Rector runs | Rector can make incorrect transformations in edge cases | Always dry-run first, review changes, run on small batches |
| Forgetting PHP extensions | Extensions change behavior or get deprecated between versions | Audit all required extensions before upgrading |
