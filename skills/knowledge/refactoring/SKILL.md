## Best Practices

- Refactor in **small, verified steps** — execute tests after every change
- Follow the **Boy Scout Rule**: leave code in better shape than you found it
- Reach for **IDE refactoring tools** when available for safe, automated transformations
- Never refactor and alter behavior simultaneously — keep them separate
- Prioritize refactoring that **lowers coupling** and **raises cohesion**
- Tackle code smells **nearest to your current work** first
