# Design Patterns

A thorough reference covering 26 design patterns organized by intent — creational, structural, and behavioral — featuring PHP 8.3+ implementations, UML guidance, and practical use cases.

## Pattern Index

### Creational Patterns
- **Abstract Factory** — Produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes → [reference](references/abstract-factory.md)
- **Builder** — Assemble complex objects through a step-by-step process → [reference](references/builder.md)
- **Factory Method** — Declare an interface for object creation, letting subclasses determine the concrete type → [reference](references/factory-method.md)
- **Prototype** — Duplicate existing objects without coupling to their concrete classes → [reference](references/prototype.md)
- **Singleton** — Guarantee that a class has exactly one instance → [reference](references/singleton.md)
- **Object Pool** — Recycle expensive-to-create objects for repeated use → [reference](references/object-pool.md)

### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter** — Translate one interface into another that clients expect → [reference](references/adapter.md)
- **Bridge** — Separate an abstraction from its implementation so both can evolve independently → [reference](references/bridge.md)
- **Composite** — Arrange objects into tree structures for uniform treatment → [reference](references/composite.md)
- **Decorator** — Layer new behaviors onto objects dynamically through wrapping → [reference](references/decorator.md)
- **Facade** — Offer a streamlined interface to a complex subsystem → [reference](references/facade.md)
- **Flyweight** — Minimize memory usage by sharing common state across many objects → [reference](references/flyweight.md)
- **Proxy** — Manage access to an object through a surrogate → [reference](references/proxy.md)
- **Private Class Data** — Limit access to class attributes → [reference](references/private-class-data.md)

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Chain of Responsibility** — Route requests through a chain of handlers → [reference](references/chain-of-responsibility.md)
- **Command** — Represent requests as standalone objects → [reference](references/command.md)
- **Interpreter** — Establish a grammar representation and an interpreter for it → [reference](references/interpreter.md)
- **Iterator** — Walk through elements without revealing the underlying structure → [reference](references/iterator.md)
- **Mediator** — Tame chaotic dependencies through a central coordinator → [reference](references/mediator.md)
- **Memento** — Snapshot and restore object state without breaking encapsulation → [reference](references/memento.md)
- **Null Object** — Supply a do-nothing default to eliminate null checks → [reference](references/null-object.md)
- **Observer** — Automatically inform dependents when state changes → [reference](references/observer.md)
- **State** — Change behavior when internal state transitions → [reference](references/state.md)
- **Strategy** — Make algorithms interchangeable at runtime → [reference](references/strategy.md)
- **Template Method** — Outline an algorithm skeleton and let subclasses fill in specific steps → [reference](references/template-method.md)
- **Visitor** — Introduce operations to objects without altering their classes → [reference](references/visitor.md)

## When to Use Which Pattern

| Problem | Pattern |
|---------|---------|
| Need to create families of related objects | Abstract Factory |
| Complex object construction with many options | Builder |
| Want to defer instantiation to subclasses | Factory Method |
| Need copies of complex objects | Prototype |
| Need exactly one instance globally | Singleton |
| Incompatible interfaces need to work together | Adapter |
| Want to vary abstraction and implementation independently | Bridge |
| Tree structures with uniform treatment | Composite |
| Add responsibilities dynamically without subclassing | Decorator |
| Simplify a complex subsystem interface | Facade |
| Many similar objects consuming too much memory | Flyweight |
| Control access, add lazy loading, or log access | Proxy |
| Multiple handlers for a request, unknown which handles it | Chain of Responsibility |
| Queue, log, or undo operations | Command |
| Need to interpret a simple language/grammar | Interpreter |
| Traverse a collection without exposing internals | Iterator |
| Reduce coupling between many communicating objects | Mediator |
| Need undo/snapshot capability | Memento |
| One-to-many event notification | Observer |
| Object behavior depends on its state | State |
| Need to switch algorithms at runtime | Strategy |
| Algorithm skeleton with customizable steps | Template Method |
| Add operations to object structures without modification | Visitor |

## Best Practices

- Favor **composition over inheritance** — reach for Decorator, Strategy, or Bridge before resorting to deep class hierarchies
- Apply patterns to address **real problems**, not hypothetical ones
- Leverage PHP 8.3+ features: **enums** for State, **readonly classes** for Value Objects, **first-class callables** for Strategy
- Combine patterns when it makes sense (e.g., Builder + Fluent Interface, Strategy + Factory Method)
- Keep pattern implementations **minimal** — if the pattern introduces more complexity than it resolves, reconsider the approach
