## Overview

The Facade pattern is a structural design pattern that interposes a simplified interface between callers and a complex subsystem. Instead of requiring every consumer to understand and orchestrate multiple interdependent classes, the facade provides a single entry point that handles coordination internally, allowing the subsystem's internals to change without affecting outside code.

## Intent

The Facade pattern addresses subsystem complexity by providing:

- A unified entry point that manages multi-step internal workflows on the caller's behalf
- Simplified access to functionality that would otherwise demand coordination across several objects
- A boundary that prevents internal implementation details from leaking into client code
- Reduced cognitive load for developers who consume the subsystem
- A stable contract that absorbs internal restructuring without propagating changes outward

## Problem and Solution

**Problem:** A subsystem comprises many cooperating classes, and every consumer must learn their individual roles, mutual dependencies, and invocation order. This coupling makes client code verbose, fragile, and expensive to maintain.

**Solution:** Place a facade class in front of the subsystem that offers a curated set of high-level operations. The facade delegates internally to the correct subsystem objects and manages their sequencing, so callers interact with a clean, narrow API and remain unaware of the machinery behind it.

## Structure

The Facade pattern involves these participants:

- **Facade:** Provides a simplified interface and knows which subsystem classes handle requests
- **Subsystem Classes:** Implement the actual functionality; unaware of the facade's existence
- **Client:** Uses the facade instead of directly accessing subsystem classes

Key characteristics:
- One-way dependency: Facade depends on subsystems, not vice versa
- Facade is optional (subsystems can still be used directly if needed)
- Often reduces the number of classes client needs to know about

## When to Use

Use the Facade pattern when:

- A subsystem's internal complexity should not leak into calling code
- Multiple consumers need to perform similar multi-step interactions with a subsystem
- You are integrating modern code on top of a legacy system and want a clean boundary
- You need clear layer boundaries -- for example, between presentation and business logic
- The subsystem's internal structure is likely to change while clients should remain stable
- You want to reduce the number of types that appear in a client's import list

## Implementation (PHP 8.3+)

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

namespace DesignPatterns\Structural\Facade;

// Subsystem classes - complex internal implementation
class Database {
    public function connect(): void {
        echo "Connecting to database...\n";
    }

    public function query(string $sql): array {
        echo "Executing query: $sql\n";
        return [['id' => 1, 'name' => 'Example']];
    }
}

class Cache {
    private array $store = [];

    public function set(string $key, mixed $value): void {
        $this->store[$key] = $value;
        echo "Cache set: $key\n";
    }

    public function get(string $key): mixed {
        return $this->store[$key] ?? null;
    }
}

class Logger {
    public function log(string $message): void {
        echo "[LOG] $message\n";
    }
}

// Facade: Simplified interface to the subsystem
class DataRepository {
    public function __construct(
        private readonly Database $db,
        private readonly Cache $cache,
        private readonly Logger $logger
    ) {}

    public function fetchUser(int $userId): ?array {
        $cacheKey = "user_$userId";

        // Try cache first
        $cached = $this->cache->get($cacheKey);
        if ($cached !== null) {
            $this->logger->log("User $userId retrieved from cache");
            return $cached;
        }

        // Fall back to database
        $this->logger->log("Querying database for user $userId");
        $this->db->connect();
        $results = $this->db->query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $userId");

        if (!empty($results)) {
            $this->cache->set($cacheKey, $results[0]);
            return $results[0];
        }

        return null;
    }

    public function saveUser(int $id, string $name): bool {
        $this->logger->log("Saving user $id: $name");
        $this->db->connect();
        $this->db->query("INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES ($id, '$name')");
        $this->cache->set("user_$id", ['id' => $id, 'name' => $name]);
        return true;
    }

    public function clearCache(): void {
        $this->logger->log("Clearing all cache entries");
        // Cache clearing logic
    }
}

// Client code - simple interface, no knowledge of subsystems
$db = new Database();
$cache = new Cache();
$logger = new Logger();

$repository = new DataRepository($db, $cache, $logger);

// Just use the facade - no need to orchestrate subsystems
$user = $repository->fetchUser(1);
$repository->saveUser(2, 'John Doe');
$repository->clearCache();
```

## Real-World Analogies

- **Travel Agent**: Instead of separately booking flights, hotels, car rentals, and excursions through different agencies, a travel agent handles all the coordination and gives you a single itinerary.
- **Hospital Reception Desk**: A patient checks in at the front desk, which routes them to the correct department, schedules tests, and coordinates with insurance -- the patient never contacts each department individually.
- **Smartphone Home Screen**: Tapping an app icon launches a complex chain of OS services -- memory allocation, network access, GPU rendering -- but the user only sees a single tap-to-open gesture.
- **API Gateway**: A single endpoint aggregates calls to multiple backend services, translating between external consumers and internal microservices.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- Client code becomes shorter and easier to reason about
- Consumers depend on the facade's stable interface, not on internal subsystem classes
- Internal restructuring stays invisible to callers as long as the facade contract holds
- Complex multi-step workflows are encapsulated in one place
- Establishes natural architectural boundaries between layers
- Tests can mock one facade interface instead of many subsystem collaborators

**Cons:**
- A facade that tries to cover every subsystem operation risks becoming an oversized god object
- Simplification may hide useful subsystem features that power users need
- Trivial subsystems gain no benefit from an extra abstraction layer
- The facade itself becomes a maintenance bottleneck -- every subsystem change may require a facade update
- If the facade goes down, all clients that depend on it are affected
- Developers still need subsystem knowledge for edge cases that the facade does not cover

## Relations with Other Patterns

- **Adapter:** Adapter reconciles mismatched interfaces; Facade condenses a complex subsystem behind a simpler one
- **Decorator:** Decorator augments a single object's behavior; Facade simplifies access to an entire group of objects
- **Strategy:** A facade can offer different strategy implementations for varying subsystem configurations
- **Factory Method:** Facades often use factories internally to instantiate the subsystem objects they coordinate
- **Singleton:** A facade is frequently a singleton when system-wide access to the subsystem is needed
- **Abstract Factory:** Can sit behind a facade to produce families of subsystem objects transparently
- **Command:** Commands can be queued through a facade to schedule subsystem operations
- **Observer:** A facade can surface event subscriptions from the subsystem to external listeners

## Additional Considerations

**When Designing Facades:**
- Keep the facade interface simple and focused
- Delegate to subsystem classes, don't duplicate logic
- Consider providing multiple facades for different use cases
- Use dependency injection for subsystem components
- Document the facade's interface thoroughly
- Allow direct subsystem access if advanced users need it

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Creating a facade that's as complex as the subsystem it hides
- Tightly coupling the facade to client code
- Making the facade responsible for subsystem creation (use factories instead)
- Preventing clients from accessing subsystem classes when needed
- Over-engineering simple systems with unnecessary facades
