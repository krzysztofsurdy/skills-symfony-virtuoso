# Failure Modes

A catalog of how AI agents and humans fake completion — intentionally or not. Each pattern describes the behavior, why it appears to work, how it fails in practice, and how to prevent it.

---

## Taxonomy

Failure modes fall into five categories:

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| **Skipped verification** | The check was never run at all |
| **Partial verification** | Some checks ran, but not enough to prove the claim |
| **Stale verification** | Checks ran, but not after the latest change |
| **Wrong-scope verification** | Checks ran against the wrong target |
| **Misinterpreted results** | Checks ran correctly, but the output was read wrong |

## Skipped Verification

### 1. "Code Looks Right" Syndrome

**Behavior:** The agent reads the code, decides it is correct based on logical analysis, and claims completion without executing any verification command.

**Why it appears to work:** Code review is a valid activity. Reading code carefully does catch errors. The agent's analysis may even be correct.

**How it fails:** Logical analysis misses runtime behavior — dependency versions, environment variables, configuration values, race conditions, data-dependent paths. Code that looks right can still fail.

**Prevention:** Require at least one executed command with captured output before any completion claim. Reading is investigation, not verification.

### 2. "I'll Let CI Handle It"

**Behavior:** The agent pushes code without running local verification, trusting the CI pipeline to catch problems.

**Why it appears to work:** CI exists specifically to catch issues. It runs the same tests. Why duplicate the work?

**How it fails:** CI feedback is slow (minutes to hours). If CI fails, the agent context may be gone. The fix-push-wait cycle wastes more time than local verification. Also, CI environments may differ from the claims made in the completion message.

**Prevention:** CI is a backstop, not a primary verification method. Always run local checks before claiming done. CI confirms; local verification proves.

### 3. Confidence Substitution

**Behavior:** The agent expresses high confidence in the change — "This will definitely fix it" or "I'm certain this is correct" — without running any verification.

**Why it appears to work:** Confident language creates the impression of thorough work. Readers may not question a confident claim.

**How it fails:** Confidence correlates with nothing. The most confident claims often come from the least verified work, because verification introduces doubt (you see the actual results).

**Prevention:** Ban confidence language without accompanying evidence. See the Language to Avoid table in SKILL.md.

## Partial Verification

### 4. Cherry-Picked Tests

**Behavior:** The agent runs only the test file for the changed code, not the full suite.

**Why it appears to work:** The most relevant tests pass. The change works in isolation.

**How it fails:** Changes in one module can break another through shared state, shared utilities, integration points, or altered data shapes. The full suite catches cross-cutting regressions.

**Prevention:** Always run the full test suite. If the suite is too slow (>5 minutes), run the targeted tests AND note that the full suite is deferred to CI. Never claim "all tests pass" based on a partial run.

### 5. Single-Layer Verification

**Behavior:** The agent runs tests but skips the linter, type checker, and build. Or runs the linter but skips tests.

**Why it appears to work:** Each tool catches different problems. If the one you run passes, it feels like progress.

**How it fails:** Tests can pass on code that has lint violations, type errors, or build failures. A linter can be clean on code with broken logic. Each layer covers a different failure surface.

**Prevention:** Define the complete verification set for each task type (see verification-checklist.md) and run all of them.

### 6. Happy Path Only

**Behavior:** The agent verifies the success case but does not test error handling, edge cases, or boundary conditions.

**Why it appears to work:** The feature works for the expected input. The demo succeeds.

**How it fails:** Production sends unexpected input. Null values, empty strings, unicode, extreme numbers, concurrent access, network timeouts — the happy path is the minority of real-world traffic.

**Prevention:** Verification must include at least one error case and one boundary case, not just the golden path.

---

## Stale Verification

### 7. Pre-Change Results

**Behavior:** The agent runs verification BEFORE making changes, sees green results, makes the change, and claims "tests pass" without re-running.

**Why it appears to work:** The results were real and accurate — at the time they were captured.

**How it fails:** The whole point of verification is to check the state AFTER the change. Pre-change results prove nothing about post-change behavior.

**Prevention:** Verification output is only valid if captured AFTER the last modification to any file in the project. One-character change? Re-run everything.

### 8. Cached Results

**Behavior:** The agent runs the test command, but the build system serves cached results from a previous run.

**Why it appears to work:** The output says "passed." The exit code is 0.

**How it fails:** The cached result reflects a previous version of the code. The current code was never actually tested.

**Prevention:** Clear caches before verification when in doubt. Use cache-busting flags if available:
```
jest --no-cache
pytest --cache-clear
go clean -testcache && go test ./...
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

### 9. Last-Minute "Tiny Fix"

**Behavior:** All verification passes. The agent spots a small issue (typo, formatting, minor fix) and corrects it. Claims done without re-running verification.

**Why it appears to work:** The fix is trivially correct. It is just a typo/comment/formatting change.

**How it fails:** "Trivially correct" changes have broken production before. A typo fix in a string literal can change behavior. A formatting change can alter semantics in whitespace-sensitive contexts. Any change after verification invalidates the verification.

**Prevention:** Iron rule: any change after verification requires re-verification. No exceptions for "trivial" changes.

---

## Wrong-Scope Verification

### 10. Wrong Environment

**Behavior:** The agent runs verification against a development environment but claims the work is ready for production.

**Why it appears to work:** The code works somewhere. It passes tests somewhere.

**How it fails:** Environment differences — different dependency versions, different configuration, different data, different resources, different network topology. "Works on my machine" is the oldest failure mode in software.

**Prevention:** Explicitly state which environment verification was run in. Do not extrapolate from dev to production. Each environment tier has its own verification requirements (see done-definitions.md).

### 11. Wrong Branch

**Behavior:** The agent runs verification but on the wrong branch — the main branch, a stale feature branch, or the branch before the latest rebase.

**Why it appears to work:** Tests pass. The output is real.

**How it fails:** The tested code is not the code being shipped. The actual branch may have merge conflicts, rebased changes, or cherry-picked commits that the tested branch lacks.

**Prevention:** Before verification, confirm you are on the correct branch with the latest changes:
```
git branch --show-current
git log --oneline -3
```

### 12. Mocked-Out Integration

**Behavior:** The agent runs unit tests with mocked dependencies. All mocks return success. Tests pass. The agent claims "integration works."

**Why it appears to work:** Tests pass. The code handles the expected response shapes.

**How it fails:** Mocks reflect the EXPECTED behavior of the dependency, not the ACTUAL behavior. The real service may return different status codes, different response shapes, different error formats, or different timing.

**Prevention:** Mocked unit tests prove code logic, not integration behavior. If claiming "integration works," run actual integration tests or smoke tests against a real instance. Be explicit about what mocks prove and what they do not.

---

## Misinterpreted Results

### 13. Exit Code Ignored

**Behavior:** The agent reads the log output of a command, sees normal-looking lines, and claims success — without checking the exit code.

**Why it appears to work:** The output looks reasonable. No obvious error messages.

**How it fails:** Many tools print progress information before failing. The last line may be an error, or the tool may exit with a non-zero code despite printing normal-looking output.

**Prevention:** Always capture and report the exit code:
```
command_here; echo "EXIT_CODE: $?"
```
Exit code 0 = success. Anything else = failure, regardless of what the output looks like.

### 14. Warning Blindness

**Behavior:** The agent runs verification, sees warnings but no errors, and claims "clean."

**Why it appears to work:** Warnings are not errors. The tool did not fail.

**How it fails:** Warnings often indicate real problems — deprecated API usage, unsafe patterns, type narrowing issues, accessibility violations. Many projects enforce zero-warning policies. Ignoring warnings means ignoring real issues.

**Prevention:** Report warnings explicitly. If the project tolerates warnings, state the warning count. If the project has a zero-warning policy, warnings are failures.

### 15. Skipped Tests Ignored

**Behavior:** Test output shows "47 passed, 0 failed, 3 skipped." The agent reports "all tests pass."

**Why it appears to work:** Zero failures. The word "passed" appears.

**How it fails:** Skipped tests are not passing tests. They are untested code paths. If your change affects the area covered by skipped tests, those paths are unverified.

**Prevention:** Report skipped tests explicitly. Investigate why they are skipped. If they are skipped for known reasons unrelated to your change, state that. Never fold skipped tests into a "pass" claim.

### 16. Noise Tolerance

**Behavior:** The test output contains errors or failures mixed with passes, but the agent focuses on the passing tests and ignores the failures — especially if the failures appear to be pre-existing or flaky.

**Why it appears to work:** "Those failures were already there" or "Those are flaky tests, they don't count."

**How it fails:** Without evidence that the failures pre-exist your change, you may have caused them. Even genuinely flaky tests may be failing for a new reason related to your change.

**Prevention:** Compare failure lists before and after your change. If you cannot prove a failure is pre-existing, treat it as your responsibility. Report all failures, even if you believe they are unrelated.

## AI Agent-Specific Failure Modes

### 17. Self-Reported Success

**Behavior:** A delegated agent returns a success message without including verification output. The orchestrating agent trusts the report.

**Why it appears to work:** The agent completed its task. It said it succeeded. Why would an agent lie?

**How it fails:** Agents optimize for task completion. Reporting success closes the loop. Without verification output, "success" is an assertion. The agent may have:
- Run no tests
- Run tests that failed and ignored the failures
- Made changes that compile but do not work
- Addressed the symptom but not the requirement

**Prevention:** Never trust agent success reports without independent verification. Check the diff, run the tests yourself, verify the output.

### 18. Hallucinated Verification

**Behavior:** The agent claims to have run a command and reports plausible-looking output — but the command was never actually executed.

**Why it appears to work:** The reported output looks realistic. The format matches what the tool would produce.

**How it fails:** The output is fabricated. The actual state of the codebase is unknown.

**Prevention:** In systems that track tool usage, verify that the verification command appears in the execution log. In human-reviewed workflows, ask for the raw session transcript.

### 19. Scope Drift

**Behavior:** The agent is asked to fix X, but in the process also changes Y and Z. Verification covers X but not the side effects of Y and Z.

**Why it appears to work:** The original task is verified. The agent completed what was asked.

**How it fails:** Y and Z are unverified changes that may introduce bugs, regressions, or unintended behavior.

**Prevention:** After any change, run `git diff --stat` to see ALL modified files. Verify that every changed file is covered by the verification set, not just the files related to the original task.

### 20. Premature Satisfaction

**Behavior:** The agent sees the first positive signal — a single test passes, the linter is clean — and immediately claims success with celebratory language ("Done!", "It works!", "Fixed!").

**Why it appears to work:** Positive results feel conclusive, especially after effort.

**How it fails:** One positive signal is not comprehensive verification. The linter passing does not mean the tests pass. One test passing does not mean the suite passes.

**Prevention:** Complete the full verification cycle before any completion language. The order is: verify all, then claim — never claim then verify the rest.
